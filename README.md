I saw this kind of element on CodePen, with many of the examples using jQuery's Card class object.  I wanted to challenge myself to build it out from stratch.

This component uses the React Library with no other dependencies.

Building this added to my existing CSS Grid skills and pushed me to learn more about Regular Expressions.
